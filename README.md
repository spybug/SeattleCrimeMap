# SeattleCrimeMap

A website to display historic Seattle crime data on a map. This data is obtained from the public [Seattle Socrata API](https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/SPD-Crime-Data-2008-Present/tazs-3rd5/about_data), which provides data on crime. This site is not funded or backed by any official Seattle source, just developed in the spare time of a local resident ðŸ˜Š

Public data on crimes is not specific to the actual address where the crime occurred, it is usually just on a specific block. That's why most pins are grouped together.

# Map Display

This uses Leaflet and OpenStreetMaps to display the results in an easy to understand way. Groups together of pins from the same block with info on each individual crimes.
